Abstract
In recent years, the field of traditional medicine in Vietnam has been growing rapidly. Classifying herbariums has become crucial for both preservation and research purposes. However, traditional methods for herbarium classification require extensive domain knowledge, which limits accessibility for the general public. To address this challenge, we developed a deep learning model based on the EfficientNetV2 architecture, achieving a classification accuracy of 90.41%.
